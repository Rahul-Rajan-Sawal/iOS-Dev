   78: Web benchmarks are compiled from the same entry point in `lib/web_benchmarks.dart`.
   79  

   81  
   82: Create a new file for your benchmark under `lib/src/web`. See `bench_draw_rect.dart`
   83  as an example.

   87  - A "raw benchmark" records performance metrics from direct interactions with
   88:   `dart:ui` with no framework. This kind of benchmark is good for benchmarking
   89    low-level engine primitives, such as layer, picture, and semantics performance.

   99  For a raw benchmark extend `RawRecorder` (tip: you can start by copying
  100: `bench_draw_rect.dart`).
  101  
  102  For a widget benchmark extend `WidgetRecorder` (tip: you can start by copying
  103: `bench_simple_lazy_text_scroll.dart`).
  104  
  105  For a widget build benchmark extend `WidgetBuildRecorder` (tip: you can start by copying
  106: `bench_build_material_checkbox.dart`).
  107  
  108  Pick a unique benchmark name and class name and add it to the `benchmarks` list
  109: in `lib/web_benchmarks.dart`.

    1: # Dartdoc Generation
    2  

    5  
    6: To generate these code blocks, Flutter uses dartdoc tools to turn documentation
    7  in the source code into API documentation, as seen on https://api.flutter.dev/.

   23  
   24: * A `dartpad` sample, which gets placed into a full-fledged application, and can
   25    be executed inline in the documentation on the web page using
   26:   DartPad.
   27  
   28  * A `sample`, which gets placed into a full-fledged application, but isn't
   29:   placed into DartPad in the documentation because it doesn't make sense to do
   30    so.
   31  
   32: Ideally, every sample is a DartPad sample, but some samples don't have any visual
   33  representation and some just don't make sense that way (for example, sample

   43  
   44: ```dart
   45  /// {@tool snippet}

   49  ///
   50: /// ```dart
   51  /// CircleAvatar(

   61  This uses the skeleton for [snippet](config/skeletons/snippet.html) snippets
   62: when generating the HTML to put into the Dart docs.
   63  

   65  
   66: The `../bots/analyze_sample_code.dart` script finds code inside the `@tool
   67: snippet` sections and uses the Dart analyzer to check them.
   68  

   91  
   92: ```dart
   93  // Examples can assume:

   98  You can assume that the entire Flutter framework and most common
   99: `dart:*` packages are imported and in scope; `dart:math` as `math` and
  100: `dart:ui` as `ui`.
  101  

  105  
  106: The code `sample` and `dartpad` tools can expand sample code into full Flutter
  107  applications. These sample applications can be directly copied and used to

  109  `flutter create` command to create a local project with the sample code. The
  110: `dartpad` samples are embedded into the API docs web page and are live
  111  applications in the API documentation.
  112  
  113: ```dart
  114  /// {@tool sample --template=stateless_widget_material}

  117  ///
  118: /// ```dart
  119  /// Widget build(BuildContext context) {

  142  
  143: The `sample` and `dartpad` tools also allow for quick Flutter app generation
  144  using the following command:

  154  To support showing an entire app when you click on the right tab of the
  155: code sample UI, we have to be able to insert the `sample` or `dartpad` block
  156  into the template and instantiate the right parts.

  159  contains a list of templates. These templates represent an entire app that the
  160: `sample` or `dartpad` can be placed into, basically a replacement for
  161: `lib/main.dart` in a flutter app package.
  162  

  167  
  168: The `../bots/analyze_sample_code.dart` script finds code inside the `@tool
  169: sample` sections and uses the Dart analyzer to check them after applying the
  170  specified template.

  173  
  174: A skeleton (concerning this tool) is an HTML template into which the Dart
  175  code blocks and descriptions are interpolated.

  178  [application](config/skeletons/sample.html) samples, one for
  179: [dartpad](config/skeletons/dartpad-sample.html), and one for
  180  [snippet](config/skeletons/snippet.html) code samples, but there could be more.

  187  The code block generation tools that process the source input and emit HTML for
  188: output, which dartdoc places back into the documentation. Any options given to
  189  the `{@tool ...}` directive are passed on verbatim to the tool.

  191  The `snippets` tool renders these examples through a combination of markdown
  192: and HTML using the `{@inject-html}` dartdoc directive.
  193  

  208  Note that generating the sample output will not allow you to run your code in
  209: DartPad, because DartPad pulls the code it runs from the appropriate docs server
  210  (master or stable).
  211  
  212: Copy the generated code and paste it into a regular DartPad instance to test if
  213: it runs in DartPad. To get the code that will be produced by your documentation
  214  changes, run sample analysis locally (see the next section) and paste the output
  215: into a DartPad at https://dartpad.dartlang.org.
  216  

  224  ```
  225: TMPDIR=/tmp bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart dev/bots/analyze_sample_code.dart --temp=samples
  226  ```

  233  
  234: For example, the file `sample.src.widgets.animated_list.52.dart` points to the sample
  235: in `packages/flutter/src/widgets/animated_list.dart` at line 52. You can then take the
  236: contents of that file, and paste it into [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev) and see if it
  237  works. If the sample relies on new features that have just landed, it may not work

.fvm/flutter_sdk/dev/snippets/config/templates/README.md:
   3  In general, creating application snippets can be accomplished with the following
   4: syntax inside of the dartdoc comment for a Flutter class/variable/enum/etc.:
   5  
   6: ```dart
   7  /// {@tool snippet --template=stateful_widget}

  10  /// above" or "see the code below", since the location of the description may
  11: /// change in the future. You can use dartdoc [Linking] in the description, and
  12  /// __Markdown__ too.
  13  ///
  14: /// ```dart preamble
  15  /// class Foo extends StatelessWidget {

  28  /// short version of the snippet code sample.
  29: /// ```dart
  30  /// String myValue = 'Foo';

  39  
  40: This will result in the template having the section that's inside "```dart"
  41  interpolated into the template's stateful widget's state object body.

  48  
  49: ```dart
  50: /// ```dart imports
  51: /// import 'package:flutter/rendering.dart';
  52  /// ```

  55  All code within a code block in a snippet needs to be able to be run through
  56: dartfmt without errors, so it needs to be valid code (This shouldn't be an
  57  additional burden, since all code will also be compiled to be sure it compiles).

  78    state variables. It also has a `preamble` in addition to the default code
  79:   block, which will be placed at the top level of the Dart file, so bare
  80    method calls are not allowed in the preamble. The default code block is

   3: This directory contains a keycode generator that can generate Dart code for
   4  the `LogicalKeyboardKey` and `PhysicalKeyboardKey` classes. It draws information

   7  
   8: It then generates `keyboard_key.dart` (containing the `LogicalKeyboardKey` and
   9: `PhysicalKeyboardKey` classes), and `keyboard_maps.dart`, containing
  10  platform-specific immutable maps for translating platform keycodes and

  21    names to Android keycode names (with the "KEY\_" prefix stripped off).
  22: - `data/keyboard_key.tmpl`: contains the template for the `keyboard_key.dart`
  23    file. Markers that begin and end with "@@@" denote the locations where
  24    generated data will be inserted.
  25: - `data/keyboard_maps.tmpl`: contains the template for the `keyboard_maps.dart`
  26    file. Markers that begin and end with "@@@" denote the locations where

  39  ```bash
  40: $FLUTTER_ROOT/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/dart bin/gen_keycodes.dart
  41  ```

  43: This will regenerate the `keyboard_key.dart` and `keyboard_maps.dart` files in
  44  place.

   60: generated `localizations.dart` file. The Map is used by the
   61  MaterialLocalizations class.

   75  with an '@' prefix. These '@' resources are not used by the generated
   76: Dart code at run time, they just exist to inform translators about how
   77  the value will be used, and to inform the code generator about what code

   79  
   80: ```dart
   81  "cancelButtonLabel": "CANCEL",

   94  
   95: ```dart
   96  "aboutListTileTitle": "About $applicationName",

  101  
  102: ```dart
  103  MaterialLocalizations.of(context).aboutListTileTitle(yourAppTitle)

  113  
  114: ```dart
  115  MaterialLocalizations.of(context).selectedRowCountTitle(yourRowCount)

  125

  158: ### 'generated_*_localizations.dart': all of the localizations as a Map
  159  
  160: If you look at the comment at the top of the `generated_material_localizations.dart`
  161: and `generated_cupertino_localizations.dart` files, you'll
  162  see that it was manually generated using a `dev/tools/localizations`

  166  
  167: ```dart
  168: dart dev/tools/localizations/bin/gen_localizations.dart packages/flutter_localizations/lib/src/l10n material
  169  ```

  183  
  184: ```dart
  185: dart dev/tools/localizations/bin/gen_localizations.dart --overwrite
  186  ```

  196  (and the code generated for them) have been encoded using the appropriate
  197: escapes for JSON and Dart. The JSON format arb files were rewritten with
  198: dev/tools/localization/bin/encode_kn_arb_files.dart. The localizations code
  199  generator uses generateEncodedString()
  200: from dev/tools/localization/localizations_utils.dart.

  236: The Dart [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl)
  237  package supports internationalization.
